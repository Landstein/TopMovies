# Movie Project Read Me


### Team Members
Eric Landstein, Kevin Sun 

### Project Goals
To see if there are any patterns that make a movie financially successful 
1. Are there any movies that have higher than average DVD or Blu-ray sales 
2. Is there a specific month that is best for a movie to be released 
3. Are there genres that perform better then others 

### Data
We scraped the movie data from https://www.the-numbers.com/ to get the following features 

- Movie Name 
- Domestic Box Office
- Rank 
- DVD Sales
- Blu Ray Sales 

### EDA 

We started by first looking at the month a movie was released to see if there was any positive or negetive financial impact.
